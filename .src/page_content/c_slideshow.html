    Here's a simple slideshow example. It uses JavaScript to update the embedded image element. I put
    most of the demos items inside of flexboxes in hopes to make it more scaleable if I were to port it
    to another page. Every 3 seconds the slide changes to the next image; this is done by keeping an array
    that contains all the image paths. When it reaches the end of the slide, it loops back round to the first
    image displayed.

    I included buttons on the bottom that play an audio snippet, these buttons are media controllers and allow
    for the slideshow to be navigated by a person. When a button is pressed, the 3 second slideshow timer is reset.
    I also included a random button :).
