      My name is George Smith, I am currently a student studying Games Software Engineering at Bournemouth University.
      I have devoted the majority of my life so far to the games industry and programming. I've participated in quite a
      few game jams using an assortment of software, coding languages and libraries. I taught myself the programming
      fundamentals through JavaScript and the basics of Python; my knowledge has been solidified by learning C++ through
      my course as well as in my free time. I find designing and developing games to be absolutely thrilling.
